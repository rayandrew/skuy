### Idea behind the example

This is a basic, bare-bones example of how to use React and Razzle with React Native Web, React Loadable, and Redux.

The project itself is derived from [create-razzle-app --example with-react-native0web](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tree/next/examples/with-react-native-web)
combined with [create-razzle-app --example with-redux](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tree/next/examples/with-redux),[create-razzle-app --example with-react-native-web](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tree/next/examples/with-react-loadable),
and also special thanks to Natan Elia for his boilerplate [razzle with after js + redux + rnw](https://github.com/natanelia/razzle-afterjs-redux-rnw-example)
